# JavaScript-Project-2
This is the second checkpoint of Javascript Foundations

To experiment with different approaches for some functions, I implemented two methods.

Additionally, since I wasn't entirely sure about the "Count Characters" function, I created two different versions:

One that simply counts the total number of characters in a string.

Another that displays the number of occurrences of each character in the string without returning a value.
